## üéÆ Game Vault

One of the most distinctive aspects of ION is its **game vault**, which allows users to launch and play a vast collection of HTML5 and web-based games directly within the browser. Leveraging iframe technology, each game opens in a sleek modal popup, enabling fullscreen, about:blank launch, and easy downloads for offline play. This approach not only maximizes compatibility and performance but also ensures that users can switch between games effortlessly without leaving the ION environment.

## ü§ñ AI Apps

Beyond gaming, ION offers a diverse suite of **AI tools and apps**, including integrations with platforms like Github Copilot, Komo, Transfrly, and iAsk. These tools are presented as wide, visually appealing buttons and are loaded in secure iframes for a smooth, app-like experience. The AI section is designed to help users with coding, translation, research, and more‚Äîall while maintaining privacy and ease of access.

## üïµÔ∏è Proxies

Recognizing the need for privacy and unrestricted browsing, ION features a robust **Proxies** section, where users can launch various proxy services such as DOGE, FreedomProject, Nebula, RammerHead, ShadowBrowser, and UvStaticV2. Each proxy is accessible through the same intuitive modal popup system, allowing for safe, incognito browsing within the ION interface. To enhance security, this section is password-protected and includes warnings to ensure users understand the risks and responsibilities of using proxy services.

The status widget displays live information like battery status, network connectivity, and date/time, all styled to match the futuristic theme. These features ensure that ION feels not just like a website, but a true digital desktop.
